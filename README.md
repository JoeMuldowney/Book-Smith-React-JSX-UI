#  Property Management App

This React application allows users to navigate through a user-friendly interface seamlessly. It leverages React's built-in router for page transitions, the useEffect hook for data fetching on page load, and Axios for handling requests with or without parameters. Material-UI's Grid component is used to create a responsive and flexible layout, while custom CSS is integrated with JSX for enhanced styling.
